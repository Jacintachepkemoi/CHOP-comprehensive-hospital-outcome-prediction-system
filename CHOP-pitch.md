# Comprehensive Hospital Outcome Prediction System (CHOP)

**PITCH**

This project aims to predict facest of a patient's admission such as length of stay and cost. It is our vision that armed with this information, a hospital can better plan and allocate its resources.

**Business Understanding**

**Overview**

The CHOP Model aims to predict patient outcomes and optimize resource allocation in healthcare settings. By providing accurate predictions regarding patient stays, CHOP  will serve as a decision-support tool for healthcare administrators and medical professionals and administration.

**Challenges**
- **Data Availability and Quality:** Obtaining comprehensive, high-quality patient data that covers a wide range of variables is essential.

- **Complexity of Healthcare Data:** Medical data is complex. It includes medical records, lab results, and physician notes among others. Cleaning the data into a usable format will be a big undertaking.

- **Privacy and Security Concerns:** Handling sensitive patient data requires strict adherence to privacy regulations.

**Proposed Solution**

Our solution is to develop a model that given patient information, can predict aspects of their stay including duration and cost. By having a better picture of patient needs, the hospital can more efficiently plan for allocation of resources such as beds and staff.

**Metrics of Success**

1. **Model Accuracy**: Achieving high accuracy in predicting patient outcomes is imperative.
3. **User Acceptance**: Positive feedback from medical proffesionals regarding the model's usability and insights.
4. **Compliance and Security**: Adherence to ethical standards and data privacy regulations.

**Problem Statement**

Hospitals struggle to accurately forecast patient recovery times, potential complications, and necessary resources such as staff and beds. This uncertainty can result in either ***over-preparation*** 
(wasted resources), or **under-preparation**(poor service).

**Objectives**
- **Develop a Predictive Model:** Create a model capable of accurately predicting patient outcomes, including recovery time and likelihood of complications.

- **Optimize Resource Allocation:** Use the modelâ€™s predictions to optimize the allocation of hospital resources, such as staff, equipment, and beds, ensuring they are used efficiently and effectively.

- ***Model Accuracy:*** 80% has been set as the baseline for a successful model.

**Data Understanding**

**Data Sources**

The **MIMIC-IV** Clinical Database provides comprehensive clinical information on patients admitted to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The database contains de-identified patient data in compliance with HIPAA standards. Several subsets of the data have been pinpointed for use.

**Relevance of Data** 

The selected datasets collectively provide a holistic view of patient information, covering demographics, clinical diagnoses, lab results, and treatment services.
