# Amazon Review Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This project is aimed at understanding customer opinions and satisfaction through the analysis of textual feedback provided by users. The dataset consists of a large number of reviews across various products, each containing valuable insights into customer experiences. This project seeks to develop a sentiment classification model that can accurately categorize these reviews into sentiment categories such as positive, negative, and neutral. Armed with  machine learning and natural language processing techniques, the goal is to gain actionable insights from customer feedback to inform product improvements and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Problem Statement
The primary issue is to accurately classify the sentiment of customer reviews on Amazon products. Given the vast amount of reviews and their diverse nature, the challenge is to develop a model that can effectively discern sentiments (positive, negative, neutral) from textual data to provide actionable insights into customer opinions and improve product offerings.

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset of Amazon reviews sourced from huggingface.co. The project will include data collection, preprocessing, and application of sentiment analysis techniques. By leveraging machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) methods, we aim to create a sentiment classification model that can extract valuable insights into customer satisfaction and product performance.

## Challenges
1. **Data Quality**: Reviews often contain informal language, slang, and various writing styles, which can complicate preprocessing and sentiment classification.
2. **Sentiment Granularity**: Differentiating between nuanced sentiments, such as mildly positive vs. strongly positive, can be challenging.
3. **Model Accuracy**: Achieving an accuracy of 80% in sentiment classification while dealing with imbalanced datasets.
4. **Scalability**: Efficiently processing a large volume of reviews while ensuring that the model remains accurate and responsive.

## Objectives
1. **Develop a Robust Sentiment Classification Model**: Create a model that can classify Amazon reviews into sentiment categories with an accuracy of at least 80%.
2. **Gain Insights from Review Data**: Extract actionable insights regarding customer satisfaction and identify key areas for product improvement based on sentiment analysis.
3. **Create a Dummy Store**: Develop a storefront using FastAPI and Python for demonstration purposes.
4. **Deploy Model**: Deploy the model to the store and enable the user to add new reviews to the products.
5. **Product Sentiment Extraction**: Have the model able to assess the overall sentiment around a given product by combining all reviews.

## Success Metrics
1. **Model Accuracy**: A model accuracy of 80% or higher is required.
2. **Functional Storefront**: A webapp for a test store is developed and deployed.
3. **Model Intergration**: The model is able to interact with the store to analyze reviews.

## Proposed Solutions
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Implement techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, and removal of stopwords to clean and prepare the text data for analysis.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Use methods like TF-IDF, word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe), or contextual embeddings (e.g., BERT) to transform text into features suitable for machine learning models.
3. **Model Development**: Experiment with various models, including traditional machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM, Random Forest) and advanced neural networks (e.g., LSTM, Transformer models) to identify the best approach for sentiment classification.
4. **Model Evaluation and Optimization**: Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Perform hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to optimize the model.
5. **Deployment and Scaling**: Develop a strategy for deploying the sentiment analysis model to handle large volumes of reviews efficiently, ensuring that the system is both scalable and maintainable.
